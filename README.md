# 4D-Maze
Using a disjoint set data structure, **hunt and kill** algorithm, and random points algorithm, the given main file will generate a 4D Maze. This program will output a binary representation of the given walls starting from (0,0,0,0) up to (N-1, N-1, N-1, N-1). The current **main.cpp** file will generate a 4D maze that is 35x35x35x35 big. If you would like to generate a smaller maze, you can change **constant int N** in the **main.cpp** file. The **main.cpp** is currently using random maze generation function **mazeGenerationAlgorithm()**. If you would like to see **hunt and kill** algorithm, uncomment the code below **// Generate Maze Using Hunt-And-Kill Algorithm.** Then proceed to comment out the **mazeGenerationAlgorithm()** function in the main.
